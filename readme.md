## What is The Car Collector?
The car collector allows for you to keep track of cars. These can be cars you own or cars you've owned in the past or even your dream cars.

Each car you add you can be specific to the year manufactured, make, model, and even leave a personalized description of the car. You will be the only user able to see your collection of cars.

## IceBox Features
I would like to add a second entity called Detailing. This would create a many to many entity that allows to add detailing equipment to cars to keep them nice and shiny and smelling fresh.
